              My mission is to help people and organizations to achieve their
              goals and to help them to achieve their goals. I am a self taught
              developer and I am constantly learning new things and trying to
              improve myself.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I am currently working on a new project, this project is called{" "}
              <a href="/projects/cloud" className="link">
                KaliCloud
              </a>{" "}
              and it is a cloud computing platform that allows users to create
              their own virtual machines and manage them. This project is
              currently in development and will allow people to access and learn
              how to deploy their own cloud easier than ever before.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I want to help new or experienced IT students or experts, or
              simpliy someone who needs to deploy infrastructure. By opening
              doors that will fast track their career and help them to achieve
              their goals. This project will be a milestone for making cloud
              technolegy accessable to anyone and anywhere.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Thi project has been many months in the making and have granted me
              more knowledge about the cloud, this is an very ambitous project
              and I want to share my skills and my knowledge in order to make a
              difference in how we build and deploy applications, websites and
              servers.
            </p>
            <p>
              This will help future IT companies and students create and build
              applications much faster without making it hard for them or time
              consuming in order to launch their service

            <h3>How did I get here?</h3>
            <p>
              I started off at the age of 14 as someone who thought technolegy
              was awesome and I wanted to make it a reality. I started to learn
              about the world of technology and I started to learn about the
              world of computers and I started to learn about the world of
              software development, this is when I descovered my love for
              technolegy.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Fast forward 1 year, I started to work on my first project in web
              development, at this time I started to focus on website frameworks
              after learning the basics. This really got me thinking, what was
              possible? I figured that this answer is infinate as now we have
              much more features at our disposal including SSR (Server-side
              rendering) and realtime dom updates using React, Vue or the many
              frameworks that brings great technical features.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I was 15 and 16 I began learning about C++ and C# which I had
              previous experience with C#, this is when I learned new things
              such as: Heap allocation and game cheats (which turned out to be a
              great experience and a challenge).
            </p>
            <p>
              I began my C++ journey by using cheat engine combined with C++ to
              hook programs which I could then use to get address pointers, and
              I got my hands on learning reverse engineering using: IDA Pro.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I started my using ida pro to reverse a simple c++ program that I
              made which I had a password in which you would need to enter to
              use it, this got me learning Assembily and commands such as JMP,
              CALL, RET, JZ, JNZ, etc
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>Fast forward to the year 2023</p>

            <h3>My College journey</h3>
            <p>
              I started my college journey on a btec level one but within two
              weeks I got put on to btec level two, this is when I started to
              learn more: Digital Audio and video. This also got me into the
              world of networking which was very good for me to learn, while
              learning networking it got me thinking how valuable as a skill it
              will be. This is when I became fascinated with networking, I would
              go home and lab with Packet Tracer all the time, I built many
              networks using Wans and Lans. I even built a real network in my
              house! using Unifi
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I bought the dream machine pro and the unifi ac lite access points
              in order to make my own custom network, I learned how SDN works
              (Software-defined networking). This was the time I got hands on
              with enterprise grade technolegy and I loved it, from the
              configuration of devices to administration of the network
            </p>

            <h4>Digital video and digital audio</h4>
            <p>
              I originally had made many songs previouslly early on when I was
              14, I made: At the club and many other songs, one notible song I
              created was: "I made this on my ipad". The title of the song is as
              true as it says, I created it using my ipad and it was really
              good, even good so that Spotify actually had my account manually
              reviewed and made me an verified official artist. This got me
              access to special events and deals in which I could further
              explore the music world
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I ended up giving this up a few years later, as music just wasn't
              my passion. it was IT!
            </p>
            <p>
              When I was in college, I got to do this again on a smaller scope
              as well as doing digital video, I started out by reviewing two
              different video products and after this I was able to create my
              digital video, which will be in{" "}

            <h3>Digital Graphics and animation work</h3>
            <p>
              In college I also got my hands on doing digital graphic work which
              was very interesting to learn as I've never done graphical work
              using programs such as Photoshop and Visio, I liked using Visio
              over Photoshop primarily because Visio is build for making Digital
              Vector graphics, photoshop is on the otherhand, used for editing
              existing digital graphics such as Bitmap. This is when I started
              to learn to create two different graphic products, one for Advet
              and one for a user guide, this was when I started to build digital
              graphics. I also did outline designs for them:

            <br />
            <p>
              I also did digital animation which was fun to do, for my
              assignment I had to create a 30 second animation in which I would
              have to theme it around Health and Getting fit. I used Scratchy in
              order to complete my animation which is a online tool that allows
              you to create quick animations, I used this to knock up an simple
              annimation for the assignment. Here's the result:
